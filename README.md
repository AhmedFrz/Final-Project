## FINAL PROJECT - SEGMENT 1. 

## Selected Topic: 


The Effects of COVID-19 on the Global Macroeconomy.


## Reason Why They Selected Their Topic: 


The COVID-19 pandemic has tossed the world into a state of uncertainty, not only from a health standpoint but also from an economic perspective. With global laws that have been enacted requiring many businesses to shut down early and limiting the number of people engaged in gathering activities, this has taken a toll on the level of consumption and total output that build a country’s economy. Our interest in this topic pertains to our willingness to explore the different ways and to what degree ecological forces like the global COVID-19 pandemic can affect a country’s economy both short term and long term.



## Description of Their Source of Data:


Size of data: 200 to 230 countries

## Questions the Team Hopes to Answer With the Data:

1. Which countries were most and least affected by Covid-19
2. What income group the countries affected fall into?
3. Is GDP per capita a determinant of cross-country differentials in impact of Covid-19?
4. Is HDI a determinant of cross-country differentials in impact of Covid-19?
5. Is population size a determinant of cross-country differentials in impact of Covid-19?



 ## Technologies, Languages, Tools, and Algorithms Used Throughout the Project:
